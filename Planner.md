# Planner

Planner is a tool that can be used to plan your work in a scrum like manner. We'll allow users to create stories and plan those in sprints.

You'll then be able to move these stories through certain phases (Todo, Started, Done, Test, ...).

Main objects in planner are:

* Project
* Task
* Team
* User

A Project has 1 Team
A Team belongs to 1 Project
A Team has multiple Users
A User belongs to multiple Teams
A Project has multiple Tasks
A Task belongs to 1 Project
